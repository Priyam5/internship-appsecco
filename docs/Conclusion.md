# Conclusion

## Old Days

It is important to understand what used to happen in earlier days to understand the importance of cloud-native. In past, for example, we used to run a single application on a single server which lead to big expenses having included installation fees, cooling devices and administrator fees, etc. Even after getting everything done, we still lacked processing and scalability. Companies tried to buy overpowered servers, processors because they had no exact idea of how much powerful server, processors they need and it resulted in a loss of money and resources because most of the time, only 10% to 20% processing power was used.

## VMware

After VMware came, we were able to run multiple applications over a single server at the same time. But in this also system resources were consumed by the VMware only. My guest OS consumed my system resources(CPU, MEMORY, DISK), and also applications were running over these virtual OS. We need licenses for each OS which will again we have to pay. But this is not all, we also need to safely and securely run our apps directly on the server. Each VM needs patching security issues, updation, and even other firewalls and anti-viruses.

## Cloud Native Advantages

* **RESOURCES** Now, I do not have to worry about the memory, storage my system have as over here I have to deploy the applications on cloud and no more my system hanged as I was facing the issue while I was working with VMs in this [report](https://devsecops-pipeline.devsecopsgirl.in/ubuntu-server-vm-setup/)

* **SPEED** One of the great advantages of using cloud-native was it decreased the time of deploying the application, SAST scan, DAST scan, code quality analysis, SBOM on an average in my case by 80% as compared to the one I was doing while deploying the application through Jenkins pipeline in my [DevSecOps pipeline](https://devsecops-pipeline.devsecopsgirl.in).

* **SECURITY** Cloud-native applications are more robust when their development integrates with pipelines based on the CI/CD approach. AWS allows us to automate manual security tasks so we can shift our focus to scaling. With AWS, we can improve core security and compliance requirements, such as data locality, protection, and confidentiality with comprehensive services and features of AWS.
